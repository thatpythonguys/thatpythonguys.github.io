Finite groups and structure The problems and results derived from this chapter almost all concern with finite groups. We know a lot about finite groups. For example, we have this result: Theorem 1.

You can find the PDF link to my notes here, and if you want the source code, you can find that here. These notes weren’t made live in class so there was less stress on me creating these notes quickly. I do think I’ll have some classes to ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Graph Ends and Their Purpose in Geometric Group Theory</title><link href="https://thatpythonguys.github.io/Jul6th/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Graph Ends and Their Purpose in Geometric Group Theory" /><published>2022-07-06T00:10:00-05:00</published> <updated>2022-07-06T22:54:41-05:00</updated> <id>https://thatpythonguys.github.io/Jul6th/</id> <content src="https://thatpythonguys.github.io/Jul6th/" /> <author> <name>{"name"=>"Pramana"}</name> </author> <category term="Research" /> <category term="Geometric Group Theory" /> <summary> I’ll give an intuition for how mathematicians define what graph ends are, and explain their use in geometric group theory. However, before I can do that, I’ll explain what ends are in a graph theory perspective. What are ends? The word ends is a little confusing, because they don’t really represent the “end” of a graph, at least not how we would define an end in real life. Think of a rope.

However, in looking into how several fields of mathematics define a basis, it can turn out very different, and it is entirely dependent on the mathematical idea that the field is studying. So lets start with the basis that most entry-level mathematicians should be familiar with.

The proof of DeMorgan’s law provides a nice introduction to proofs and reasoning to why it works. Theorem. $(A \cup B)^c = A^c \cap B^c$ Proof. \[\begin{align*} &amp;amp;\text{First prove that } (A \cup B)^c \subseteq A^c \cap B^c \\ &amp;amp;\text{Let } x \in (A \cup B)^c. \\ &amp;amp;x \notin A \... </summary> </entry> </feed>
